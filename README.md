# ipa_check_consistency
The tool checks consistency across FreeIPA servers.

It can also be used as a Nagios/Opsview plug-in (check -n, -w and -c  options).

The tool has been tested in FreeIPA 4.2/4.3/4.4 (Centos 7.2/7.3, Fedora 24) environments.

Requirements:
* FreeIPA 4.2 or higher
* Bash 4.0 or higher

Any comments and improvement ideas are welcome.

## LDAP Conflicts
Normally conflicting changes between replicas are resolved automatically (the most recent change takes precedence).
However, there are cases where manual intervention is required. If you see LDAP conflicts in the output of this script,
you need to find the conflicting entries and decide which of them should be preserved/deleted.

More information on solving common replication conflicts can be found [here](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_directory_server/10/html/administration_guide/managing_replication-solving_common_replication_conflicts).
